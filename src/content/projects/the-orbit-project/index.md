## Step 1: Project Brief

The orbit TVET College is in need of a digital ux and brand refresh. In simple words, they want to impove how their clients interact with the digital channels, website, social media and visual elements to inform more and reach more.

### Project Details

| Schedule                            | Stakeholders|
|----------                           |------------ |
| Start date:    <br> end date:       | Orbit??     |

#### Deliverables

- Brand Refresh
- Website
  
## Step 2: Audit

To develop a proper solution an audit must be conducted to understand what are some of the areas that can bee improved. This audit is different depending on the client, and can be broken up into a business audit, brand audit and content audit or product audit. In this case I think a _**Brand and Content Audit**_ is the best fit.

The Content Audit drives everything, because we want the information being presented to not be taken away from but to stand out, we can't have friction in the avanues we are presenting this information through. The ux and the brand refresh will be based arount  the content and how it is structured and presented.
