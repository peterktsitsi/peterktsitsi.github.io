Welcom and lets begin.

My Web Design and Development process can be broken down to about 20 steps but because you most likely won't read that, I made it more like 10 steps, bear with me.

This website is both a source of pain and pride for me, a soup of strange confounding experiences and emotions, some how, I can't get into this college to save my life. I've applied, or at least tried to apply for like 5 years in a row with no luck. How?   How is that even posible? believe it or not I went to University, or maybe it was a fever dream. Seriously though, how is it easier to go to a university than a college? lets keep going...

It's a great school, lots of people I know went there and they seem to be living better then this peny pinching dev, It's serveing a pretty underserved commnunity of people but, my god... The User experience is.. is..

Something to behold. Again I say this with love, I think...  Can you tell I'm a professional?

I want to start with breaking down the first 3 out of 10 step in the summerised, ***"Process"***.

Project Brief, Audit then Defining Scope. Before we create a solution for any problem we must first understand the problem and document this, yeah say it with me now ***project management***. The project document or brief is ment to aggrigate all the information and elements of a project, from a birth day party to a web application that can read, and  write to a database.

### 1. Project Brief

***deep breath***... What is our goal for this project? We're updating the orbit college website but is that really all there is to this project? I have a feeling that there's more here, it's not that the website is bad, it's the user experience of their brand is full f friction. In my mind when i picture it, I see a space full of student art, projects and demonstations, i see patriotism, a memory making machine... again bear with me.

- Step 1 : **Defnining Objectives.**
  
  ***even deeper dreath***... Instead of a simple website how about a brand refresh? I want to change how people experience the college visually.

  let's list our objectives.. Refresh the visual presentation and user experience of the college's digital and print communication channels and methods, fancy speak for... If you can see it with your eyes then we are waking it up a bit. 

  - brand kit
  - website
  - ux refresh
  - people liking what they see ***wink wink***
